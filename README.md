# DMP
The [Dedicated Mentoring
Program](https://www.codeforgovtech.in/c4gt-2024/) is a place for
students and professionals to contribute to critical tech building
blocks with the guidance of a dedicated mentor.

Sugar Labs will be participating in DMP 2024. Details to
follow. Meanwhile, look for tickets with the **DMP2024** tag.

Applications for the program are now open and contributors can apply
via [this portal](https://bit.ly/DMP2024_Unstop) and access all the
live projects [here](https://bit.ly/DMP2024ProjectList). The
applications close on 1st May for the contributors post which the
mentors will need to share the final shortlists.

Potential contributors:
* Please refer to the [Sugar Labs documentation](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs) in regard to our code of conduct, communications guide, and getting started.
* Please note that only projects with the **DMP2024** tag will be available this year (we need to start slowly in our first year in the program).

## Timeline for DMP 2024.

Currently till the first week of May is our application period. Interested applicants will submit design proposals through our Unstop portal.

Post this we have the proposal evaluation period. This period will last from the first week of May till the 25th of May. In this time you will have to grade the proposals you have received based on evaluation parameters we will share with you and conduct interviews / assignments for shortlisted candidates. Post this, you will have to narrow down on one contributor to select from your pool of applicants.

Between the last week of May and the 11th of June, we will have the project set-up phase. Here we will have an inauguration and conduct bootcamps for the students to upskill them on the broad principles of at scale tech development. In this phase, correspondence between you and the student will also be set up. You will need to help them set-up whatever is required for your project on their local machine to ensure a smooth coding period.

Post the 11th of June, the coding period starts. The specific details as to what you would need to do during the coding period will be shared with you. The coding period will end September 10th. As previously mentioned, ongoing support for the selected contributor will require a time commitment of approximately 2-3 hours per week to ensure their contributions are impactful to the project.
