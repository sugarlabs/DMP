# 2. Camera Activity

The library lives [here](https://github.com/44yu5h/rpi_camera_activity)

Camera modules for Raspberry Pi donâ€™t use the traditional communication protocol that USB cameras use. I've implemented it using the **picamera2** library here.

You can take pictures and videos with it as one would expect. It saves the media files in `~/Pictures/Camera`

Features:
- Show/Hide the grid overlay.
- Flip the camera preview horizontally or vertically.
- Capture images by clicking the "Snap" button.
- Capture videos using "Video" button.
- Video timer indicator
