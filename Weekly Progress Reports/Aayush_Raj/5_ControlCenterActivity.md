## Features
- **GPIO Control**: Control the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
- **I2C**: View and obtain addresses of connected I2C devices.
- **SPI**: View and obtain addresses of connected SPI devices.
- **Audio**: Check and manage connected speaker and microphone.
- **Camera**: View connected cameras.
- **Settings**: Control the state (on/off) of various settings such as I2C, SPI, VNC, Boot Splash, etc.

## Development

The different tests/settings are separated and into their respective files in efforts to organize and declutter the code. In the UI they can be accessed by clicking on the respective button on the toolbar. In the backend it just changes the canvas to the next test's canvas. 

The code is simple and pretty explanatory. Looking forward to your bug-fixes and contributions. Happy coding.
